# TvShowApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.0.

## Architectural Decisions

路 Angular 7: Angular is a javascript framework, which is used for development of dynamic web apps.

路 Angular Material: Material design components for Angular.

路 Http: HTTP client for the browser

路 Karma and Jasmine: Run unit tests with Karma. Jasmin is testing framework.

## Linting
